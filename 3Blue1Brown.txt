But what is a neural network?

- Multilayer perceptron 
    - What is a nueron
        - A thing that holds a number between 0 and 1
        - number inside of the nueron is called the activation 
    - activation   
        - how positive is the weighted sum 
        - typically a sigmoid function is used but not RELU
    - bias
        - tells you how high the sum needs to be before the nueron begins to get 
        meaningly active 
    - ReLU(a) = max(0, a)
        - rectified liner unit 
        - Inactive up to a threshold and active after specific threshold
        - if the node output is positive then output will become the value itself
        - if the node output is negative it will become 0 
    - What is the purpose of an activation function: 
        - help a model account for interaction effects 
        - helps the model account for non-linear effects 
            - non-linear if the slope isn't constant 
            - slope tends to change between the different nodes

Gradient descent, how nueral networks learn

- Show the model alot of data and train the structure 
    - hopefully then the network can learn to generalize 
    - define a cost function 
        - square difference between each output and the actual 
        - will be larger when the network is more lost 
    - start with a random input, and then try to find the minimum 
        - step in the direction where the error becomes less 
        - which direcetion should we step as to decrease the output of the function fastest
        - negative gradient gives the direction 
        - repeat 
        - will create a better performance on all of the samples 
    - backpropogation 
        - a network learning is means minimizing the cost function 
    - gradient descent 
        - a way to converge toward a local minimum 
    - what nudges to the weights and biases matter the most to the cost function
